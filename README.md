# pima-indians-diabetes
Machine Learning / Deep Learning Model to outcome Population of Pima Indians with Diabetes

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset (UCI ML Repository) to build supervised learning models that predict the likelihood of diabetes onset based on medical attributes. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning/deep learning and explainable AI can support healthcare decision-making by identifying risk factors and improving early intervention strategies.

- Predict whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes based on clinical features.

- Showcase an end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing → feature engineering → model training → evaluation → explainability.

- Highlight the importance of interpretable AI in healthcare, where trust and transparency are critical.

This project help me understand health care systems based on AI and gain ability to:

 - Build robust supervised learning models;

 - Apply advanced tuning and validation techniques;

 - Deliver interpretable AI insights for real-world healthcare applications.
